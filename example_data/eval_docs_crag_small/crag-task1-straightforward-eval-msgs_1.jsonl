The Fast franchise has always played fast and loose with the rules of physics, and at the end of 2 Fast 2 Furious, the movie reached a kind of batty zenith. In a gonzo act of heroism worth of the Dukes Of Hazzard, crackpot driver Brian Spilner and wisecracking passenger Roman Pierce send their classic Chevrolet Camaro careening into the side of a luxury boat owned by drug baron, Carter Varone. We’re no physicists, but we’re guessing this tactic wouldn’t work in the real world.

Okay, I realize that Hollywood isn't likely to reform, but at least by discussing bad movie physics it's possible to repair some of the damage done to our clear thinking by constant exposure to foolishness. Sadly, Hollywood has a rational reason for affording more respect to the rules of football than the laws of physics: audiences are more likely to know them. THE IMPACT ON ARTISTIC QUALITY To understand when the rules (the laws of physics) should not be broken, it's best to start with the situations where they can or should be. These include cartoons, parodies, and fantasies. Even top-notch science fiction routinely stretches the boundaries of physics for the sake of story.

Action heroes are always performing remarkable feats in movies, and surviving accidents that would kill ordinary mortals in an instant – it’s something we practically expect from our Hollywood blockbusters. The Fast franchise has always played fast and loose with the rules of physics, and at the end of 2 Fast 2 Furious, the movie reached a kind of batty zenith. In a gonzo act of heroism worth of the Dukes Of Hazzard, crackpot driver Brian Spilner and wisecracking passenger Roman Pierce send their classic Chevrolet Camaro careening into the side of a luxury boat owned by drug baron, Carter Varone. We’re no physicists, but we’re guessing this tactic wouldn’t work in the real world. It’s the kind of ridiculous sequence that few films would get away with, but it fits with The A-Team’s camp, absurd charm. ... One of the most memorable moments in the otherwise forgettable Resident Evil sequel, Afterlife, was also one of the most outlandish – which probably isn’t a coincidence, thinking about it. Near the beginning of the movie, Milla Jovovich’s heroine Alice manages to land a little red aeroplane on the top of a Los Angeles skyscraper. This being a Fast movie, the two heroes get out of the car with little more than a scratch. The pair must have skeletons made from Adamantium. ... Jan de Bont’s relatively low budget 1994 thriller was a brisk, fun ride, thanks in part to its taut direction, but also because of its premise, which is surely the stuff of Hollywood cliché by now – crackpot bomber Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) has wired an explosive device to a busy commuter bus, which will detonate if the vehicle drops below 50 miles per hour.\n\n#### 3.

Author Tom Rogers uses basic scientific principles, such as Newton's First Law, along with a little common sense to examine and expose Hollywood's absolute worst physics offenders, including The Matrix, Speed and Star Wars. Find out how your favorite films measure up! --Would the bus in Speed really have made that jump? Okay, I realize that Hollywood isn't likely to reform, but at least by discussing bad movie physics it's possible to repair some of the damage done to our clear thinking by constant exposure to foolishness. Sadly, Hollywood has a rational reason for affording more respect to the rules of football than the laws of physics: audiences are more likely to know them. THE IMPACT ON ARTISTIC QUALITY To understand when the rules (the laws of physics) should not be broken, it's best to start with the situations where they can or should be. These include cartoons, parodies, and fantasies. Even top-notch science fiction routinely stretches the boundaries of physics for the sake of story. Time-travel is a good example of acceptable physics-bending for the sake of story. Ask ten physicists about time travel and you'll get eleven different answers, and that's with two abstaining.\n\n#### 4.
