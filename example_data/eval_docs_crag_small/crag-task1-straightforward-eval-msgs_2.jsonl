It was officially introduced on March 4, 1957 by Standard & Poor. McGraw-Hill acquired it in 1966. The S&P Dow Jones Indices owns it as of 2022 and that's a joint venture between S&P Global (formerly) McGraw Hill Financial, CME Group, and News Corp, the owner of Dow Jones. It tracks 500 publicly traded, large-cap U.S. companies. These businesses must meet specific criteria to be a part of the S&P 500. The mix of industries that make up the S&P 500 list often reflects the economic makeup of the United States. The S&P 500 tracks the market capitalization of the companies in its index. Market cap is the total value of all shares of stock that a company has issued. It's calculated by multiplying the number of shares issued by the stock price. A company that has a market cap of $100 billion receives 10 times the representation as a company whose market cap is $10 billion. It represents the stock market's performance by reporting the risks and returns of the biggest companies. Investors use it as the benchmark of the overall market, to which all other investments are compared. S&P stands for Standard and Poor, the names of the two founding financial companies.\n\n#### 2.
