    "2.PAl-Studio/Designer FAQ 2.1. FAQ about algorithm components:By default, the format conversion component runs 100 workers. Make sure that up to 100 data ent ries are converted at a time.What can I do when \"blob\" is displayed on the data presentation page of the PAl?SymptomOn the canvas of the Machine Learning Studio page, when Iright-clicked a component and selected View Data, some text is displayed as \"blob.\"Solution",
    "2.PAl-Studio/Designer FAQ 2.1. FAQ about algorithm components:Characters that cannot be transcoded are displayed as \"blob.\" Ignore this error, because nodes in the downst ream can read and process the data.What can I do when the x13-auto-arima component reports an error?Make sure that up to 1,200 training data samples are imported into the x13-auto-arima component.What can I do when the Doc2Vec component reports the CallExecutorToParseTaskFail error?",
    "2.PAl-Studio/Designer FAQ 2.1. FAQ about algorithm components:Make sure that the number of data samples imported into the Doc2Vec component is less than $2470000\\times10000.$ The data is calculated in the formula:  (Number of documents $^+$ Number of  words) x Vector length . Make sure that the number of users who use the Doc2Vec component is less than $42432500\\times7712293\\times300$ . Exceeding the preceding limits causes memory application failures. If your data size is excessively large, you can reduce the number of data samples and then calculate the formula again. Make sure that the imported data is split into words.",
